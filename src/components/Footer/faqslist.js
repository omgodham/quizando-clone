                question:"What happens if there is a draw on a Classic or Sponsored Quiz?",
                answer:"In the highly unlikely event of two or more players getting exactly the same number of points on a leaderboard-style quiz, and assuming these players are in the prize zone, the prize for all those places is added together and split equally amongst the players on the same points."

            },
            {
                question:"How much does a game cost to play?",
                answer:"To play most of the games that have cash prizes you need to use tokens. These tokens can be purchased inside the platform. Each game costs a different amount of tokens ranging from 5 to 50. Depending on which package of tokens you purchased, some games can be played for just a few cents. The amount of tokens a game costs to play is clearly marked on every quiz. In the case of Sponsored Quizzes, these require no tokens to play although the Sponsor may, in return for providing the prize, want to contact you for marketing purposes."

                question:"What happens if I am playing and I lose my internet connection?",
                answer:"You should only play Quizando if you have a strong and stable internet connection. If you do get disconnected, our system will attempt to reconnect to you multiple times but if it is unable to establish a link, your game will be over. Unfortunately, we cannot be responsible if your connection breaks during a quiz and we will not be able to refund your tokens."
            },
            {
                question:"I joined the wrong quiz. What should I do?",
                answer:"Unfortunately, if you have joined a quiz by mistake, we will not be able to refund your tokens. We suggest that you play it anyway as there is still every chance you might win!"
            },
            {
                question:"What are Free Plays?",
                answer:"Most of our Classic Quizzes allow you to have a certain number of goes for free. This allows you to get a feel for a quiz and your ability to do well in it before actually spending any tokens. Free Play attempts still count towards the final leaderboard."

            {
                question:"What happens if more than one person wins a Survivor game?",
                answer:"To win a Survivor game you need to be the last person standing – in other words the last person to get a correct answer when everyone else has got it wrong. If we reach a point where all the remaining players get the answer wrong at the same stage, then all of those players are winners and the prize will be shared equally between them. If more than one person answers the final question correctly, then they all considered survivors and the prize is split between them."

                answer:"Of course. We always love to receive ideas from players for quiz subjects and topics. We can’t promise we will be able to deliver as that depends on how specialised these topics are. But we will try our best!"
